A GPS module and a SIM800L module are used to obtain data about the current location and transmit it to a web server for storage and monitoring.

The implemented code is intended to connect the GPS and SIM800L modules to the Arduino board and retrieve location data from the GPS module. This data is then sent via the SIM800L module to a web server using HTTP and GPRS protocols.

The code starts by initialising the pins and parameters required for communication with the GPS and SIM800L modules. The GPRS connection with the internet service provider is set up by setting the appropriate APN. The code then enters a main loop where it checks the availability of data from the GPS module and updates the location information on a regular basis according to a pre-determined frequency.

In the getData() function, the validity of the location data provided by the GPS module is checked. If the data is valid, it is extracted (latitude, longitude and speed) and sent to the web server via an HTTP POST request. Otherwise, an error value (-1) is sent to indicate the unavailability of the location.

The setGPRS() function handles the configuration of the GPRS connection using the SIM800L module. This includes setting the connection type (GPRS), setting the APN and activating the bearer required for data transmission.

To monitor errors and handle connection failure situations, the code uses the watchDog() function. This monitors the responses received from the SIM800L module and triggers appropriate actions accordingly. If a predefined number of consecutive errors occur, the reboot variable is activated, which will trigger a system reset.

It is important to note that to ensure proper communication, the code uses serial communication between the Arduino board and the GPS and SIM800L modules, displaying diagnostic messages in the serial console for monitoring.
